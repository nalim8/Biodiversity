Interpreting data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.

This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.

Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:

In which park were most observations made?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
How many species are protected?
Which species is most prevalent and which is least prevalent?
